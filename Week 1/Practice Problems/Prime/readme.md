Prime numbers are defined as whole numbers greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself. So 3 is prime because its only factors are 1 and 3, while 4 is composite and not prime, because it is the product of 2 Ã— 2. In this lab you will write an algorithm to generate all prime numbers in a range specified by the user.

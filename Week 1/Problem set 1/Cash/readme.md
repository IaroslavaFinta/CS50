In cash.c, we’ve implemented most (but not all!) of a program that prompts the user for the number of cents that a customer is owed and then prints the smallest number of coins with which that change can be made. Indeed, main is already implemented for you. But notice how main calls several functions that aren’t yet implemented! One of those functions, get_cents, takes no arguments (as indicated by void) and returns an int. The rest of the functions all take one argument, an int, and also return an int. All of them currently return 0 so that the code will compile.

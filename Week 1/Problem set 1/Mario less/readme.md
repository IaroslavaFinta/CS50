Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks, a la the below.

Let’s recreate that pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself will also be taller than it is wide.

The program we’ll write will be called mario. And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 8 when prompted:

$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####

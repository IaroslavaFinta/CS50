Suppose you’re taking CS50 (if you’re reading this you probably are!) and spending time every week on each problem set. You may be wondering how many hours you’ve spent learning computer science, on average or in total! In this program, you’ll complete a function that calculates, based on a user’s input, a total number of hours or an average number of hours across a given number of days.

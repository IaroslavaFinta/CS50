If you’ve been on the internet, you might have seen “leetspeak” (or “l33tsp36k” for our purposes!), which involves the substitution of symbols for alphabetical characters, where those symbols somewhat resemble their alphabetical counterparts. In this lab, you’ll write a program to replace certain vowels with digits!

Up until now, you’ve frequently written programs for which you’ve been provided distribution code. You’ll notice when downloading the “distro” for this problem, you start with nothing more than a couple of commonly used libraries and an empty main function. In this problem, you will convert a word, which you will input at the command line, to a corresponding word with numbers replacing vowels.

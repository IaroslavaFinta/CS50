Imagine youâ€™re at the beach and want to order a number of items from the snack bar. You have a limited amount of cash on you, and you want to get a total cost for your items before ordering. In snackbar.c you will complete two functions. First is add_items which will add at least the first 4 items on the Beach Burger Shack menu. Then you will complete get_cost which will implement a linear search algorithm to search for each item you choose, and return the corresponding price.
